The C++ piscine is 42's introduction do the C++ language. C++11 features and the Boost library are not allowed, we code in C++98. The STL and the associated algorithms are only allowed in mod08.

This is the first 42 project without any norm and in a different language than C. Therefore this is the first time students encounter new programming paradigms in the 42 cursus.
